### Hello there! ðŸ‘‹
#### I'm Andrea and I've always been captivated by the realms of programming and IT:computer::robot:. With a background in Finance:chart_with_upwards_trend::chart_with_downwards_trend:, I've ventured into the world of Data Science:man_scientist:, exploring its intricacies. I'm here on Github:octocat: to learn, delving into more and more concepts and learning from scratch about topics that I'm lacking.
#### My interests cover the analysis of economic and financial data as well as alternative data to unravel insights into social phenomena.
#### I'm currently working on forecasting financial models and trading algorithms. Beyond that, I'm collaborating with friends on the amateur development of two iOS apps during my leisure hours.
#### What else can I say? I am deeply intrigued by the advances in gene therapy:dna: and the universe of healthcare:stethoscope:. As I navigate these spaces, I'm on a quest to harmoniously merge all my passions into a unified direction:crystal_ball::space_invader:
